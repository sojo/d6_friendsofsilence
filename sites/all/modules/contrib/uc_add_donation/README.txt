UBERCART : ADD DONATION README

This module is used to allow for the dynamic addition of donations to any order currently in progress.  This module is great for 
websites who offer a type of service that would entice anyone to "donate to the cause" IN ADDITION to buying certain products from
that site.   This also applies for sites that do not charge for certain products in hopes to generate revenue from hinting to their
users to donate to their cause.

This module was developed by http://www.alethiadesign.com.

INSTALLATION:

To install this module, simply click on the "Add Donation" module within the Ubercart - Extra section.

CONFIGURATION:

This module comes into action once it is installed.   What this means is that you will notice a "Add Donation" section every time that the
user checks out any product from the site.  Although this is probably good for most use cases, this can also be configured by navigating to the 
panes section of the "Checkout Settings" within Ubercart...

"admin/store/settings/checkout/edit/panes" - Once you have navigated to the following location, you then simply need to expand the "Add donation Settings"
fieldset at the bottom of the page to configure any options available to this module.
