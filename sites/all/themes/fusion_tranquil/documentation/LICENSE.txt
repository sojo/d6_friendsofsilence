End User License Agreement (EULA)

This is an End User License Agreement (Agreement) between Collective Mind LLC (Collective Mind), operating as Top Notch Themes (www.topnotchthemes.com) and Fusion Drupal Themes (www.fusiondrupalthemes.com), and you (Licensee).  When referring to both Collective Mind and Licensee as a collective, the term, "The Parties", may be used.


DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties agree that the following terms have these meanings:

"Open Source Software" means any software program, whose source code is made available for use and modification as users or other developers see fit, and which may resultantly be the collaborative work of many different developers.

"GPL" means General Public License, Version 2, as stated in the software license as drafted by Richard Stallman and as accepted within the Open Source Software community as a controlling software license for Open Source Software (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/).

"Drupal" means the Open Source Software web content management system as referred to in the software development industry as Drupal (www.drupal.org), and as covered by the GPL.

"Theme" means a website design comprised of various elements derived from Drupal as well as elements separate from Drupal, including, but not limited to, graphics, stylesheets (CSS files), mockups, photographs, and documentation, which is purchased or otherwise used by Licensee.

"Derivative Works" means those Theme elements that are derived from or dependent on Drupal, typically considered to be the PHP template files and those Javascript files that depend on Drupal or a Javascript library included with Drupal, and which are therefore subject to the GPL.

"Licensed Works" means those Theme elements that are separate works not derived from or dependent on Drupal or any other GPL works, that therefore fall outside the GPL, that are created and owned by Collective Mind or other parties, and that are considered licensed to Licensee through this Agreement, including, but not limited to graphics, stylesheets (CSS files), mockups, photographs, and documentation.

"Production Installed System" means a system on which Licensee installs or executes all or a portion of a Theme, including, but not limited to a server, workstation, virtual machine, blade, node, or partition, that is used by Licensee for dissemination of information or used to provide business functionality to anyone within the general public or within Licensee's enterprise or for anyone associated in any way with Licensee.

"Test Installed System" means a system on which Licensee installs or executes all or a portion of a Theme, including, but not limited to a server, workstation, virtual machine, blade, node, or partition, that is used solely for Licensee's development and/or demonstration purposes, but not as a Production Installed System.

"Technical Support" means any assistance provided by Collective Mind to Licensee with regard to a Theme, including, but not limited to, its installation, configuration, or use and as provided via means of telephone, email, or other electronic communications.

The Parties agree as follows:
